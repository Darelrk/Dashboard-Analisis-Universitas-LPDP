## üéØ About This Project

Choosing a university can be confusing, especially when comparing various ranking systems. This project was born from the need to simplify the search process, with a primary focus on finding **"Hidden Gems"**: universities that have outstanding study programs (e.g., Computer Science) even if their overall world ranking isn't always at the top.

All universities in this dashboard are from the official **LPDP** scholarship destination list, making it a highly relevant tool for prospective applicants.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behind the Scenes

1.  **Data Collection**
    Overall and Computer Science-specific ranking data was automatically collected from the QS, THE, and CWUR sites, using the official LPDP directory as the reference list of universities.

2.  **Cleaning & Merging**
    All raw data from multiple sources was cleaned, standardized, and merged into a single master CSV *file* using Pandas.

3.  **Visualization**
    The cleaned CSV *file* was uploaded to Looker Studio to create the interactive dashboard you can see and use.
